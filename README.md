# Coactive Culture
**Mission:** To help humans and machines work together

## Philosophy
We strive to be the best and serve as a role model for company culture. However, we are not alone in this pursuit, nor should we pretend to be. We learn from the strengths and weaknesses of other great companies to push the frontier because good isn't good enough. Our culture draws inspiration from the best of the best companies in the world while adding fresh perspective and thoughtful review, making it uniquely Coactive.

Remember, we will all embody this culture together, so it's up to each and every one of us to live by the following:

## Guiding principles
The **8** guiding principles below define the basis for our culture. They serve as a policy to help us to cope with or overcome the obstacles we will face. Like the guardrails on a highway, they direct our actions, so we stay on track. 

#### 1. View our culture as our first and most important product.
Culture is who we are, how we act, and what we say. It is our pioneering product, and we treat it as such, continuously building and deploying the best version of it.

### Who we are
#### 2. Help each other succeed.
It's a relay race, not a 100m sprint. We own our part and give it our all, but only win by working together as one team. We are all supporting roles.

#### 3. No bystanders.
We do not shy away from responsibility and accountability. We take ownership so nothing falls through the cracks, and we are not afraid to pitch in and share the load.

#### 4. Remain humble and grateful.
In victories and in defeat, we never lose sight of the bigger picture, and we put aside our egos, always showing gratitude for what we have and towards one another.


### How we act
#### 5. Move boldly and deliberately.
Failure does not scare us, but we also do our best to mitigate the impact on our customers, partners, and each other. Like a Cheetah, we take calculated steps before fiercely springing into action and relentlessly pursuing our goal. 

#### 6. Act pragmatically and empathically.
When working with customers, partners, and each other, we think carefully about our decisions but never forget that respect, thoughtfulness, and empathy is deserving to any and all.


### What we say
#### 7. Have the hard conversations upfront.
We value feedback and do not shy away from crucial conversations. Through clear, thoughtful, and constructive dialogue, we can learn and go further together.

#### 8. Have an opinion and the evidence to back it up.
Opinions are valued. We want everyone to have them and encourage active, thoughtful dialogue around each thought regardless of where the suggestion comes from  (yes, including the CEO). We also present the reasoning behind our opinions, so others can poke holes and understand when our advice is applicable.
